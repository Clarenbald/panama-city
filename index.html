<h2>My Family</h2>
<div class="family"><p>My family and I used to do Taekwondo for <a href="http://www.ataonline.com">ATA</a>, we went to Panama City, Florida in order to participate in a tournament. We spent a lot of time there, playing on the beach and just enjoying the attractions in general. Depicted to the left is my older brother(Green), my little sister(Pink), and myself(Blue). I don't really remember much of that night but I can say that it was a lot of fun.</p></div>

<h2>My experiences</h2>
<div class="include"><p>Some of the things we did included: Go to the tournament, watch some adults practice their moves, then we went back to the hotel and got some of our stuff before heading down to the beach for a beach party under the stars. However my favorite thing was watching my brother practice his Taekwondo. I liked to watch him because I looked up to him and he was much better than me at all of this. </p></div>

<h3>About me and Traveling</h3>
<p>I really enjoy going on trips and vacations. My favorite place to go is the beach and big cities, even though I want to live in a small city. I want to travel the world and get to see a bunch of sights. I don't like being tied down to one place too long. Out of all places I really want to visit Romania. That's the place my girlfriend's family is from and I want to take her there some day. So, to keep it short I love traveling and want to keep traveling.</p>
